If you are uncomfortable posting your full name, please include only your first name, or something that identifies how you knew Dan (ex. \u201CDan\u2019s friend from high school\u201D).\r\n-\tTry to minimize grammatical and spelling mistakes. Using a word processor and then copy\/pasting might be a clever idea.\r\n"
